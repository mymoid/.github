# How to contribute

For any contribution you had in mind, you have two options:

1. Open a detailed `Issue` on what you are contributing and why following the issue template.

2. Feel free to drop into the `Discussions` to reach out to us to ask any questions.

This way, there can be room to have a productive discussion before any code is written. It can be discussed if the contribution is a good fit for this project, fine tune contribution goals, and more.
